# Bootstrap 3
Projects using Bootstrap 3
Though in future I wish to work with Bootstrap 3 here. But Today(21 sep)
I'm working with **Mastering Markdown** the are of building static html
help file on *github*.

**Lets see what markdown is:**

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of
writing on the GitHub platform.

**Here is some bold text** and *this texts are italic*

#Heading 1
##Heading 2
###Heading 3
####Heading 4
#####Heading 5
######Heading 6
This is a paragraph

This is another paragraph, but I don't know how to
break the line.

###Here is some list items

**Un-Ordered List**
* List 1
* List 2
    * Sub List 1
    * Sub List 2

**Ordered List**

1. List1
2. List2
    * Sub List 1
    * Sub List 2
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b
